# Development Notes

- [ ] Recreate site using Tera
	- theme: abridge
	- [ ] Builds pages (shortcode/template)
	- [ ] Guides
	- [ ] Tag table for known tags
	- [ ] Keymapping
- [ ] Hook up gw2search/chatr/buildwars as [tera functions](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#functions):
	- `tera.register_function("chatcode", chatr(chatcode));`
	- in template `{{ chatcode('[&DQMGOyYvOTcqDwAA5RYAAKMAAABXFgAA8BUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]') }}`
- [ ] Build keybind shortcodes for armory markup
	- [ ] Weapon based: eg "Hammer 3"
		- look up skill name
		- use number of keypress
	- [ ] Skill based: eg "Tornado"
		- if utility, find where it's mapped in build
		- if heal, 5
		- if elite, 0
		- if weapon-skill requested by name, look up skills in weapon
		- if anything else no keybind
- [ ] LONG TERM: don't use armory, and have our own static code
