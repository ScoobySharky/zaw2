# LI Alternatives

We don't hold a monopoly on LI builds here at Accessibility Wars. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some other places to find accessible builds.

* [Hardstuck](https://hardstuck.gg)
* [Masel (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@MaselMMO)
* [MrMystic (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/c/MrMystic1)
* [MukLuk LI Builds](https://mukluklabs.com/gw2-build/tag/Low+Intensity)

## Also Explore!

Additionally, many "standard" builds can function perfectly well in a Low Intensity way with minor modifications, such as camping a single weapon. That can open up some additional options after some experimentation.

For a player with accessibility needs, some of these builds may be unworkable, but some might fit well.

* [GuildJen](https://guildjen.com/builds/) - builds for all game modes; one of the few sources for roaming WvW builds
* [Lord Hizen (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/c/lordhizen) - solo-capable open-world builds
* [SnowCrows](https://snowcrows.com/guides?q=getting-started) - mostly builds for 10-person raids; Very much not LI focused, but includes good resources for how to measure dps using golems and arcdps
* [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/) - builds for 5-person fractals. Note that discretize builds typically assume use of Fractal potions for extra stats
