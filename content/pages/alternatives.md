We don't hold a monopoly on LI builds here at Accessibility Wars. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some other places to find accessible builds.

Additionally, many "standard" builds can function perfectly well in a Low Intensity way with minor modifications, such as camping a single weapon. That can open up some additional options after some experimentation.

For a player with accessibility needs, some of these builds may be unworkable, but some might fit well.

## Build Sites

#### [MukLuk LI Builds](https://mukluklabs.com/gw2-build/tag/Low+Intensity)

Mukluk has a lot of varied content, but has a [dedicated LI tag](https://mukluklabs.com/gw2-build/tag/Low+Intensity)

#### [Hardstuck](https://hardstuck.gg)

Hardstuck has posted a number of LI specific builds, mostly for Open World

#### [GuildJen](https://guildjen.com/builds/)

Builds for all game modes. This is one of the few sources for roaming (non-zerg) WvW builds. Not explicitly LI, but builds marked
with a green star are on the simpler side.

## Specialized Sites

#### [SnowCrows](https://snowcrows.com/)

Builds for raids. Snowcrows was not originally LI focused, though they do have some beginner builds.
Their [profession sections](https://snowcrows.com/guides/professions) give a great overview for each profession that is worth reading.
They also includes [good resources for how to get started in raids](https://snowcrows.com/guides/getting-started)

#### [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/)

Discretize hosts builds for 5-person fractals. Note that discretize builds typically assume use of Fractal-specific potions for extra stats.
