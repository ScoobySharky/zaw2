This is a LI Scourge build provided by jupiter. It has a lot of variation, and centers around supporting yourself and your minions with the scourge's shades.

## Tier Notes

Start at 1, work up the list.

1. Use <span data-aw2-key="1" data-aw2-skill="10698"></span> and <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="44296"></span> off cooldown. Maintain your shade uptime by using <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="44946"></span> somewhat frequently.
2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="10709"></span>
3. As in 2, + <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="44663"></span> (OR: Change <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="10533"></span> to <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="10544"></span> and use that off cooldown).

Once comfortable, experiment with changing traits. Either Blood Magic or Death Magic can be swapped for Curses (top/x/bot, mid/x/bot, or x/x/mid) or Soul Reaping (top/x/bot, with x being top or mid). It is also beneficial to eventually work on using as many of <span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="40813"></span>,<span data-aw2-key="F3" data-aw2-skill="43448"></span>,<span data-aw2-key="F4" data-aw2-skill="44428"></span> as is comfortable if using the Soul Reaping variant, as Dhuumfire has a 1 second ICD and when proc'd deals quite a lot of DPS.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Nightmare
- Scepter/Torch Strength/Earth

## Variants

The sigils are pretty loose in this build, so use what you like. Blood is about +200 hp/s, malice is higher dps than earth over long fights. Cele can be replaced with Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using Dire swap sigils to Agony + Venom. Runes can be swapped for Rune of the Tempest or 5x Trapper + 1x Black Diamond. There are many trait variants, which are noted in the Tier Usage.
