This Daredevil build is a a little more on the moderate side of difficulty. Follow along the tier notes to find your spot.

## Tier Notes

Either Staff or P/P can be used. 

1. Auto-attack. Spam <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="29911"></span> (Staff) or <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="13011"></span> (Pistol). 
2. As in 1, + time dodges to line up with initiative dumps if using Bounding Dodger. If not using Bounding Dodger, there is no further complexity. 
3. There is no further complexity. Focus on avoiding attacks. 

If comfortable with the tiers above, experiment with replacing <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="13064"></span> with <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="13057"></span> or <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="30868"></span> and using the skill off cooldown.

## Variants

Mararder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s. Bounding Dodger can be exchanged for Unhindered Combatant for extra mobility. Either Staff or Pistol can be used with this build. No Quarter can be taken instead of Invigorating Precision for a massive DPS boost at a somewhat significant sustain cost.
