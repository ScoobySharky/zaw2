This signet-heavy Weaver build sets up a single weave. There is no element swapping necessary, reducing the complexity of Weaver greatly. That said, this build is one of the more intense builds on the site.

## Tier Notes

Camp <span data-aw2-key="F3" data-aw2-skill="5494"></span> Mainhand and <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="5492"></span> Offhand.

1. Auto-attack + use <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="43074"></span>
2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="44998"></span>
3. As in 2, + swap to <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="5492"></span>/<span data-aw2-key="F3" data-aw2-skill="5494"></span> and use <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="45313"></span>. 

If comfortable with the above, consider swapping the Bolstered Elements trait to Weaver's Prowess and/or swapping <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="5570"></span> or <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="5571"></span> to <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="40183"></span> (or <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="40183"></span>).

## Gearing

- Marauder armor
- Runes of Vampirism
- Knight trinkets
- Marauder weapons
- Sword/Dagger Strength/Blood

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Accuracy is a large DPS boost over Blood. <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="5570"></span> or <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="5571"></span> can be replaced with <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="5502"></span> or any other utility of your choice.
