A player on the AW2 Discord was looking for a Low Intensity Core Guardian build. We didn't really have one, so he made one. Here it is!

It's been well tested in Open World, and provides alternatives for WvW. Instanced PvE testing feedback is very welcomed, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/bKt2CdS8k3) and let us know how it went.
