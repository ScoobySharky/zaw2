2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="12490"></span> (axes) or <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="12475"></span> (gs, use after 2) or <span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="31568"></span> (longbow)

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s. Axe/Axe, Longbow, and Greatsword all work. If using Longbow take "Lead the Wind" in Marksmanship for piercing.
