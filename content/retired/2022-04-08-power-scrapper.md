Spam is on the menu today! This Scrapper build allows you to find your personal sweet spot between turret spam and gyro spam.

## Tier Notes

1. Auto attack and spam <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="5862"></span> along with laying down turrets.
2. As in 1, + Spam <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="30088"></span>
3. As in 2, + Spam <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="30665"></span> or <span data-aw2-key="F4" data-aw2-skill="6178"></span>.

## Gearing

- Marauder armor
- Runes of Vampirism
- Knight trinkets
- Marauder weapons
- Hammer Force/Accuracy

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s. If using <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="30713"></span>, Celerity can provide additional quickness, and Concentration will help with boons. The turret slots are very flexible, especially if you are comfortable using more active utilities like elixirs or gyros.
