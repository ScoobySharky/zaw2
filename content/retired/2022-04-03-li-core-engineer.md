## Tier Notes

Start at 1, work up the list. Start in Flamethrower <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="5927"></span>.

1. Use auto-attacks off cooldown(<span data-aw2-key="1" data-aw2-skill="5928"></span>). Drop your turrets and group mobs near them.
2. As in 1, + spam <span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="5977"></span> off cooldown.
3. As in 2, + occasionally drop Flamethrower for a moment to use Pistol <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="5831"></span>.

Once comfortable, experiment with removing 1-2 turrets and using Elixirs, like <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="5862"></span> and <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="5821"></span> in their place.

## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Traveler
- Pistol/Pistol Strength/Smoldering 

## Variants

Celestial can be swapped for Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using Dire, change runes to Balthazar. Alchemy -> Inventions may be worth testing due to the number of turrets in this build.
