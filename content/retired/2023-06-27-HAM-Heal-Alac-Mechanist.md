# Rotation

Autoattack. Don't forget to set auto-attack (right-click) on your mech abilities, 
<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="63365"/>,
<span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="63293"/>,
<span data-aw2-key="F3" data-aw2-skill="63141"/>

Press <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="63169"/> off cooldown, and use your bubble <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="63262"/> particularly for projectile defense
