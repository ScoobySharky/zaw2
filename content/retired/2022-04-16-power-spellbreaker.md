This moderate intensity Spellbreaker build uses signets for passive bonuses, and enjoys high fury and might uptime. This is a melee-heavy build, making movement control a potential factor.

## Tier Notes

1. Auto-attack, <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="45252"></span>, <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="14403"></span>.
2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="44004"></span> OR <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="45160"></span>.
3. As in 2, + <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="44004"></span> OR <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="45160"></span>, + activate <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="14355"></span> off cooldown

If comfortable with the above, consder swapping your mainhand to an axe and using <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="14421"></span> off cooldown.

## Gearing

- Full Marauder armor & trinkets
- Runes of Vampirism
- Marauder Dagger/Dagger Force/Accuracy

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker and Knight, though knight will perform considerably worse.

Keep your sigils the same on this one, as crit is very important and force is pretty strong.

Arms can be traded for Tactics (more sustain, slightly more active) or Discipline (more DPS, much more active).

Defense can be traited for much more passive defense, and may be recommended if you find yourself struggling with the base build.
