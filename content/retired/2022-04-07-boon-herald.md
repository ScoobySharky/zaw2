Mukluk has updated his LI build from 2022 for the reality of living in a post-soto relic world.

Make sure to take a look at the video at the bottom of the page, as it's broken down into greater detail, and some alternatives are provided. I've posted his quickness variation here.

For a DPS-only variation, swap the Elevated Compassion (Quickness) trait for Forceful Persistance (Stacking Damage Buffs)
