This low-moderate complexity Reaper build has you diving in and out of shroud, while your minions poke away.

## Tier Notes

1. Auto-attack and enter reaper's shroud (<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="30792"></span>) any time you can + use <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="30504"></span> both in and <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="29855"></span> out of shroud.
2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="30557"></span> in and <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="29740"></span> out of shroud.
3. As in 2, + <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="30163"></span> out of shroud or <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="29958"></span> (do not double tap) inside shroud.

If comfortable with the above, consider swapping <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="10533"></span> to <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="10607"></span> or changing Death Magic to Soul Reaping.

## Gearing

- Full Marauder
- Runes of Vampirism
- Greatsword Force/Accuracy

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s. Use Axe/x for a ranged option though your DPS suffers.
