This signet- and explosives-heavy Mechanist build lets you blow stuff up and laugh maniacally.

## Tier Notes

Start at 1, work up the list. Start in Bomb Kit <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="5812"></span>.

1. Auto attack with bombs (<span data-aw2-key="1" data-aw2-skill="5842"></span>).
2. As in 1, + choose one mech skill and spam it
3. As in 2, + drop bombs to use <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="63169"></span> occasionally. 

There is not much complexity with this build and it doesn't have much further to go. If comfortable with the above tiers, spam your mech skills.

## Gearing

- Marauder armor
- Marauder weapons
- Runes of Vampirism
- Knight trinkets
- Mace/Shield Force/Accuracy

## Variants

Keep mace mainhand, offhand doesn't matter. Blood sigil provides +200 hp/s. Can use Marauder or Zerker, or increase/decrease Knights to your preference. Turrets are fairly strong if you don't like signets. Rifle can be very strong but is much harder to use and IMO outside the scope of LI.
