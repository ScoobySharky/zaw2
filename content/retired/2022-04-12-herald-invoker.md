This relatively low-intensity Herald build is melee-ranged, but brings a bunch of defensive options for those tough moments.

## Tier Notes

1. Keep <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="28379"></span> active for fury and auto-attack. Choose <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="26644"></span> (more dps) or <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="27760"></span> (Defense) as well. If using Shiro <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28134"></span> or Jalis <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28419"></span>, maintain Impossible Odds <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="27107"></span> or Hammers <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="26557"></span> respectively instead.
2. As in 1, + use sword <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="29233"></span> off cooldown. 
3. As in 2, + legend swap (<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28085"></span>) any time your energy hits 0. This allows you to maintain more facets in glint.

Can choose to camp either offhand sword (useful teleport) or shield (+60 toughness and useful block). 

If comfortable with the above, use Sword <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="28472"></span> off cooldown. The full version of this build is one of the easiest DPS builds to play in the game, so its recommended to take a look if you want to move further up the tiers.

## Legendary Stances

These are all options. Also see Variants below:

- Glint<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28085"></span>/Shiro<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28134"></span> (boons + dps)
- Shiro<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28134"></span>/Jalis<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28419"></span> (dps + defense)

## Gearing

- Full Marauder
- Rune of Vampirism
- Set 1: Sword/Sword Force/Air
- Set 2: Sword/Shield Force/Air

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s.

Pick your Legend from Glint<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28085"></span>, Shiro<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28134"></span>, or Jalis<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28419"></span>. In each one you will maintain specific upkeep skills while activating the same set of sword/x skills. Generally, I recommend Glint<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28085"></span> as it strikes a great balance between damage and defense.
