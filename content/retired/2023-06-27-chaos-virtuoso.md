Low Intensity DPS Condition Virtuoso

# Description

Take special attention with the gearing, it's less straightforward that most.

## Rotation

No need for weapon swap. You only spam Dagger <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="62560"/> and Dagger <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="62607"/>.

> Note that Dagger <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="62607"/> is ground-targeted as of June 27

Whenever you have 5 blades you cast <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="62586"/> or <span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="62616"/>.

If you want to increase DPS you can cast the elite: <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="24755"/> or <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="62597"/> if you are stocked with blades and both <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="62586"/> and <span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="62616"/> are on cooldown.

> Note that <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="62597"/> is no longer a block as of June 27

Don't bother casting phantasms since there are no traits improving them.

- *Blocks:* You have 3 blocks always available since they are not part of the rotation, 
  <span data-aw2-key="F4" data-aw2-skill="68273"/>,
  Sword <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="10280"/>,
- *CC:*
  Sword <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="10280"/>,
  <span data-aw2-key="F3" data-aw2-skill="62602"/>,
  <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="10232"/>,
  Torch <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="10189"/> (requires weapon swap)
- *Stun Break:*
  Signet of Midnight <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="10234"/> is a stun break and it's always available since it's not part of the rotation

## Features

- Every time you press an F skill you gain Stability for 5s so you basically have perma stability.
- If you want to increase damage by a small amount you can swap Blink to Rain of Swords and also use Torch4.
- 3% of your condition damage is recovered as heal and every time you create a blade you gain 350 health (Signet of Ether).

## Alternative Off-Hand Weapons

Since you don't need to cast any skills from the off-hand weapon for the basic rotation, you can use any off-hand weapon, such as Focus for pulls or Sword for blocks.

## Additional Notes

Food is important to get to 60% precision, with Fury you get to 100% crit chance.
Your DPS is drastically affected if your Fury uptime is not 100%.
Try not to press any other buttons if you are not sure how the build works because your dps might actually drop, it's literally just those 4 buttons (2, 3, F1, F2) and elite if you want to.
