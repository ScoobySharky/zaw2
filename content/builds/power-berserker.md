Absolutely everything this build has extends berserk. Your goal is to get into berserk as fast as possible and stay there, as long as you're hitting
targets. The main difficulty is going to be to re-engage with the next target once you kill something. Take particular note of the mobility section,
as getting back into combat is your biggest priority
