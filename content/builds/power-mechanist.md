## Notes

To play this build, you want to place
{{ skill(id="5818") }}Rifle Turret
at the start of the fight, then press
{{ skill(id="30713") }}Hammer 5 Thunderclap, 
{{ skill(id="30088") }}Hammer 2 Electro-Whirl, and
{{ skill(id="63095") }}Overclock Signet
off cooldown, and that is basically your rotation.

## Crowd Control

You have decent CC. Primarily, {{ skill(id="30665") }}Hammer 3 Rocket Charge
will make your Mech do Rocket Punch, which is a CC, but do take note that since the cooldown of Rocket Punch is longer than that of
{{ skill(id="30665") }}Hammer 3 Rocket Charge
it will not always be available.

Other CC skills that you have are:
- {{ skill(id="63253") }}Force Signet
- {{ skill(id="63095") }}Overclock Signet

If you still need more CC, replace 
<span data-aw2-skill="5818"/>Rifle Turret with
<span data-aw2-skill="6161"/>Throw Mine.
