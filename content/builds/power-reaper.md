Classic power reaper spin to win playstyle. Generally speaking, this plays like:

- Step 1: Prep (with abilities/wells/minions/carapace)
- Step 2: Spin
- Step 3: Repeat

## Gearing

This plays very tanky and comfy. You can increase DPS by swapping out to Berserker's pieces pretty easily. Dragon's trinkets can be swapped to Berserker's for a cheaper option.
