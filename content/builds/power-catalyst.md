## Notes

The Opener is probably the hardest part of this rotation, but it boils down to:

1. Start in <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="5494"/> Air Attunement
1. <span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="5734"/> Glyph of Storms
1. <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="62940"/> Deploy Jade Sphere
1. <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="30795"/> Warhorn 5 Lightning Orb
1. <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="30008"/> Warhorn 4 Cyclone
1. <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="44998"/> Sword 2 Polaric Leap
1. <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="43803"/> Sword 3 Quantum Strike
1. Swap to <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="5492"/> Fire Attunement and begin the rotation

You can remember this rotation as a flexible combo, as follows:

1. Attunement
1. Deploy Jade Sphere
1. Sword 2
1. Sword 3

This works with both Fire and Air. It even works with Earth if you want to dip into Earth for more DPS.

Use <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="30795"/> Warhorn 5 Lightning Orb and <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="30008"/> Warhorn 4 Cyclone
right before you swap into Fire Attunement.

Use <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="5638"/> Arcane Wave once at any time while you are in Fire Attunement.

Finally, use
<span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="29533"/> Fire Warhorn 5,
<span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="5734"/> Glyph of Storms, and 
<span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="5666"/> Glyph of Elementals off cooldown.

I personally like to use
<span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="5734"/> Glyph of Storms in Air and
<span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="5666"/> Glyph of Elementals in Fire, but it doesn't affect the end DPS much regardless, if at all.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are Air 2 and 4, Water 4, Earth 2 and 5. Dropping rotation to CC loses more DPS the longer you stay out of Fire/Air Attunement. The DPS loss can be reduced by using Deploy Jade Sphere, Water 3, and Earth 2, 3, and 5. This might leave you with not enough energy for your next Deploy Jade Sphere. If you do not have enough energy for Deploy Jade Sphere, it is okay to either skip it or use it as soon as it is available.
