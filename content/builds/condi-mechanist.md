- Trinkets: Viper's
- Weapons: Viper's Pistol/Pistol with Sigils of Bursting/Earth
- Relic of the Fractal
- Food & Utility: Cilantro Flatbread & Toxic Focusing Crystal

## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQMGJyY5RjUNGwAAGhsAAA4bAAAQGwAACRsAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]") }}

## Notes

Use all skills off cooldown in the following priority order, which is shown on screen as well:

1. <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="5831"/> Pistol 4 Blowtorch
2. <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="5829"/> Pistol 3 Static Shot
3. <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="5828"/> Pistol 2 Poison Dart Volley
4. <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="63113"/> Superconducting Signet 
5. <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="63095"/> Overclock Signet

Your CC skills are, in order of priority:

1. <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="63253"/> Force Signet
2. <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="5830"/> Pistol 5 Glue Shot
3. <span data-aw2-key="F4" data-aw2-skill="63050"/> Crash Down (by unsummoning and summoning Mech)
4. <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="5829"/> Pistol 3 Static Shot (which makes your Mech do Rocket Punch, but since the cooldown for Rocket Punch is longer that the skill, it might not have CC)

I actually forgot to put on my Sigil of Bursting, so this build does easily ~1k more DPS than the number in the log. You can expect 33.5k DPS.
